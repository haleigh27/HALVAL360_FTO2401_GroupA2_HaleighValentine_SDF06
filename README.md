# Learning Reflections README

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

In this project, I recreated a simplified version of an Instagram profile page focusing on CSS layout and styling. This involved applying various CSS techniques including grid, flexbox and media queries to achieve a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design that functions well across different devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: Using grid and flexbox to stucture the webpage elements was interesting. It really made position elements on the page easier.
- **Responsive Design**: I implemented media queries to ensure the webpage looks good on both mobile and desktop screens. Using grid and flexbox also heled with responsive design as the gallery images can wrap into into the next line if the screen width shrink by a certain amount.
- **Styling Elements**: I used CSS to style the various elements on the webpage so that it is visually appealling.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: Adjusting the layout for smaller screens was challenging and required some trial and error. I initially coded the grid for the gallery to have three columns so when I did the media query I adapted it manually for a medium and small screen size. However, I then changed the columns to auto with a minimum and maximum value. This simplified things a lot as the gallery mostly ajusted by itself and I just needed to adapt the profile area.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Figuring out how to make the text appear above the element on hover and focus was challenging. I eventually used relative and absolute positioning for this. Implementing transitions and keyframes was easier than during the button project as a result of the research done then and the subsequent scrimba animations course that was done during the week.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I would like to become more comfortable with layouts and css properties so there is less time wasted on trial and error.
- **Code Optimization**: I think I need to learn to structure my code better and implement more of the shorthand properties so it is more readable.
- **Creative Design Choices**: For this project I stuck to the given design to focus on correcting the layout, however in I would like to implement more creative design choices in future.

#### Overall Learning Experience

Overall, I found this project quite challenging and spent quite a lot of time completing it. I did however enjoy implementing the css that I learnt. Styling the page did require some trial and error as well as some additional research but it's a good learning experience and I plan on trying to style more webpages to practice the techniques learnt this week.
